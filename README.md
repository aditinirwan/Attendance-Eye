Hostel Management System for monitoring attendance and enhancing security using MTCNN and VGG16 models for face recognition.

As part of our capstone project, our team developed a hostel management system to tackle the problem of manual attendance system and late entries through already existing cameras, student leave entry registration as well as to track student movement in and out of the hostels. I was responsible for developing the deep learning model for the same. The fast MTCNN model with an accuracy of 99.8% was used for face detection. The VGG16 model with a few additional layers for optimization with an accuracy of 88.9% was used for face recognition. This model was trained on a dataset of 500 images of 50 students and tested in the hostel Q of our campus. Along with this model, I also developed a script for extracting information from emails sent to the warden as leave application along with automated mails being sent to parents for confirmation and also in case of late entry of a student. Overall, this project was a step to enhance the security system of the campus hostel.
